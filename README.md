this was forked from a debt collector bot i created to automate a prak between me and a friend but i repurposed the code so it would serve as a scrip capable of sending messages using any of our @creativenetworklive accounts even if you dont have direct access to them, like ceo@creativenetworklive.com.

 It uses the sendgrid api that was already configured by me to our domain so you'll have to retrieve a key from our 1password and save the variable locally in your computer to run the script correctly.

Look for our API Key in our 1Password and follow SendGrid Documentation to set up the local variable:
